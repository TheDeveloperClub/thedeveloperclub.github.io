The Developer Club was founded in September of 2017 with the objective of promoting the digital infrastructure in the Copenhagen International School community. As the club believes technology and design lie at the heart of well being in today's society, the founders felt there was a desperate need for technological betterment in their community. The club wanted to take on that challenge and catalyze the modernization of the CIS ecosystem, through increased interconnectivity, transparency and better UI/UX of its digital platforms. The club aims to achieve this by pursuing a range of projects including improvement and creation of website for clubs and more.
The International School of Copenhagen was founded in 1963 as the fifth IB school, over the years the student body has grown to 930 pupils, representing over 80 nationalities. In early 2017 the school moved to a new campus in the Copenhagen Nordhavn area. The new building is almost completely covered in 12,000 blue-tinged solar panels, which will supply more than half of the schoolâ€™s annual electricity consumption. Along with additional sustainability measures the school is among the most environmentally conscious internationally.
