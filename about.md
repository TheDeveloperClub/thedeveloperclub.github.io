The International School of Copenhagen was founded in 1963, being a founding IB school (the 5th). Over the years the student body has grown to 930, representing over 80 nationalities. Recently, in early 2017 the school moved to a new campus in the Copenhagen Nordhavn area. The new building is almost completely covered in 12,000 blue-tinged solar panels, which will supply more than half of the schoolâ€™s annual electricity consumption.</p></center>
